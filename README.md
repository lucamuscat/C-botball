C-botball
--------------
This repo includes some of the code that I wrote whilst competing in the "ECER 2018 botball tournament" (I competed under team "Aloybotics", finishing third in Botball:Double Eliminations). This code was about to be used in the tournament was about to be used during the tournament but got scrapped in the last minute due to changes in tactics and strategies.
